Imagine the following situation. To make a simple data analysis project as reproducible as possible, we propose to create a container environment using Docker which contains the necessary tools and scripts. We have two use cases: a) we would like to run the Python scripts in a headless form and b) we think that a Jupyterlab is useful environment to play around with the data analysis.

In order to create a Dockerfile for these use cases, a scrambled Dockerfile has been created and is provided as starting point for this exercise.

Have a look at this Dockerfile and bring the statements in the correct order so that building the Docker image works fine.
